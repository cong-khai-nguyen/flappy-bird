# Flappy Bird
* Note: Since Google Colab server doesn't have video card, we can only see how many generatations and statistics with each bird generations and not the graphic itself.

# Description
In this project, apart from recreating the game flappy bird, which was created in 2013 by Dong Nguyen, I implemented NEAT or Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies. Different than the original flappy bird, this game is played and controlled by AI. The implementation of NEAT gives the bird the ability to ideally run indefinitely and never lose.
